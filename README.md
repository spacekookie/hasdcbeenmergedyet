# Has DC been merged yet?

This is a stupid joke.

## Why

There is an AMD linux driver component called DC (previously known as DAL) which was meant to be merged at the beginning of 2016. Since then the code base has faced an uphill battle to be mainlined, with some DRM maintainers complaining about the core principle of the module and saying that it would result in unmaintainable code.

In the meantime AMD consumers have been screwed over because features such as HDMI audio and freesync can't be used with the open source (and in general more performant) driver until DC is merged. But with each passing kernel release window there is another article on [phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com) explaining how *unfortunately* DC hasn't made it into this versions changes. What a shocker.

**UPDATE**: DC IS BEING MERGED IN 4.15! WUHU! \o/
